#  Hey , This is Vishal Tiwari

Smart Contract Engineer specializing in decentralized systems across EVM and Solana. I work on designing secure smart contracts, scalable backend services, and full-stack architectures for production Web3 applications.

## Focus Areas
- DeFi protocol design: AMMs, perpetuals, liquidity mechanics
- Smart contract development in Solidity and Rust
- Full-stack dApp engineering: on-chain → backend → frontend
- Security, gas optimization, and audit-ready code
- Distributed backend systems and event-driven workflows
